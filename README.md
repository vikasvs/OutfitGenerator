Oliver will recomend outfits for you depending on the weather and some preferences that include: formalness, style, waterproof, and comfort.

You create the outfits and input them into the database. Once they are in the database Oliver keeps track of the outfits allowing you to recycle or wear outfits and have the action be reflected in the database. 

You can customize how many times you would wear an article of clothing, and after its been worn that many times it will be removed from the database until you do your laundry(in which case you can hit reset). If you dont like the choice for the day just hit recycle and new options will show up.
