Oliver will recomend outfits for you depending on the weather and some preferences that include: formalness, style, waterproof, and comfort.
You create the outfits and input them into the database. Once they are in the database Oliver keeps track of the outfits allowing you to recycle or wear outfits and have the action be reflected in the database. 
if you wear an outfit that outfit will no longer show up in options because presumably you've put it to wash. When you hit recycle a new option will show up, but outfit wont be deprecated in the database. When you finish laundry hit the reset button and all your clothes will appear back in the database.
